    "info": "A poached egg is an egg that has been cooked without its shell in simmering water until the white is set and the yolk remains runny. This moist-heat cooking method results in a delicate texture, and the runny yolk acts as a rich sauce when it is cut into. Poached eggs are versatile and often served for breakfast or on top of dishes like toast, salads, or Eggs Benedict.",
